# 🤝 Contributing to ShadeUI

---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ShadeUI!


## 🚧 Contributions Are Not Open (Beta Phase)

Currently, ShadeUI is in its **Beta phase** and we are not accepting external contributions at this time. 

During this stage, we are focusing on:

- Stabilizing core components
- Refining the system architecture
- Collecting feedback from early users



## 📩 Feedback Is Still Welcome

Even though direct contributions are paused for this Beta, we highly value your feedback!

- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
- You can also reach out directly via email or community channels.

Your feedback will help guide the direction of future releases.



## 🔮 What’s Next

Once ShadeUI reaches a stable release, we plan to open contribution opportunities to the community.  
At that time, full guidelines and development instructions will be provided here.
